Feeling:
We want the players to feel like they need to concentrate on the game in order to win.
They shouldn't feel that frustrated at the game's controls.
They should feel that the sound effects enhance the experience.

Other:
All assets are either part of the Unity Standard Asset Package or assets that we made ourselves.
We performed playtesting and used it to improve our game, but it will take time to organize all of it, so it is not included here.
